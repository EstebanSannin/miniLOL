miniLOL is just a mini CMS-like application that uses only javascript and xml
so the server doesn't require any special capabilty like CGI stuff.

The configuration is really easy and adding pages and files is simple, just
read the XML files in resources/ and the comment will introduct you to the
aim of the file.

If you want to add content put it in the data/ folder.

Modules are in javascript and into modules/.
