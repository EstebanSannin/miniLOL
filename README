miniLOL is a complete while lightweight CMS.

It's written in Javascript and it uses a lot of XML for configurations and such.

It's really powerful but sadly there's little documentation, I'll write something someday.

If you want more informations about how it works read INTRODUCTION.

miniLOL is already 1 year old so it's pretty stable now.

Notice that the release package uses the Theme Switcher module that enables users to choose
the theme to use. There are 3 themes installed by default, two by me (one copied from a friend's website)
and another from an user. To stop using the module and use the theme you want just delete the line in
resources/modules.xml with Theme Switcher and add a <theme>The Theme You Want</theme> to resources/config.xml.
