miniLOL is just a mini CMS-like application that uses only javascript and xml
so the server doesn't require any special capability like CGI stuff.

The configuration is really easy and adding pages and files is simple, just
read the XML files in resources/ and the comment will introduce you to the
aims of the file.

If you want to add content put it in the data/ folder.

Modules are in javascript and into modules/.
