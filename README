miniLOL is a complete while lightweight CMS.

It's written in Javascript and it uses a lot of XML for configurations and such.

It's really powerful but sadly there's little documentation, I'll write something someday.

If you want more informations about how it works read INTRODUCTION.

miniLOL is already 1 year old so it's pretty stable now.
